      '''

      Function for providing the labels for the task of
      Text Describes Image

      Input:
      * Length of the dataset, i.e the total number of data points
      * sample_ratio: The percentage of the total length, which you want to shuffle

      Output:
      * d_arr (dummy array): The array which contains the indexes of the images
      * Labels: Whether the image has been shuffled with some other image or not


      Example:
      d_arr,labels = labels_for_tdi(100)

      Explanation:
      Suppose, the array is [1,2,3,4,5], so, the steps are as follows:

      * Choose some arbitrary values, (refer the samples_to_be_changed variable) (let us suppose [2,4])
      * Generate the permutation of the same, and replace the arbitary values with their permutations (one permutation can be [4,2], and hence the array becomes
      [1,4,3,2,5]
      * And then, if the original arr and the d_arr's arguments matches, put a label of 1, else put 0, hence the labels array becomes [1,0,1,0,1]


      The purpose of returning d_arr is, because the d_arr[i] would be the argument, which is responsible for becoming the d_resized_scaled_img of ith encoding dictinary vector

      i.e if d_arr[i] == i (means not shuffled), the d_resized_scaled_img of ith entry would be same else resized_scaled_img,
      else d_sized_scaled_img[i] = resized_scaled_img[d_arr[i]]

      '''
      samples_to_be_changed = int(sample_ratio*length)
      arr = np.arange(length)
      d_arr = arr.copy()
      labels = np.ones(length)
      sample_id = np.array(random.sample(list(arr), samples_to_be_changed))
      new_sample_id = np.random.permutation(sample_id)
      d_arr[sample_id]=new_sample_id
      labels = (arr==d_arr).astype(int)

      return d_arr,labels


## Purpose: Reading the json file from the path and return the dictionary
def load_json_file(file_path):
  with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
  return data

## Purpose: Getting the address of specific file type, eg: .pdf, .tif, so and so
def get_specific_file(path, last_entry = 'tif'):
  base_path = path
  for i in os.listdir(path):
    if i.endswith(last_entry):
      return os.path.join(base_path, i)

  return '-1'
